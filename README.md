Pygame Murdle Grid - (simple Pygame grid to track playing a basic Murdle game).

# Getting Started
For example on a current Mac installation in a terminal after cloning this repo.
- change into the cloned repo `cd pygame-murdle-grid`
- create python virtual environment `python3 -m venv venv`
- activate the new environmentthe `source venv/bin/activate`
- install the Pygame module using the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file and pip3, `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- start the Program `python3 ./pygame-murdle-grid-simple.py`

# Using
Reading the Murdle Puzzle page use the Pygame grid to record your guesses rather than using a paper, pen or pencil.
On each square type either 'Y' or 'N' to change the colour to 'Green' or 'Red' accordingly to get to your culprit.
The axis are labbelled S1-S3, L1-L3 and W1-3 for Suspects, Locations and Weapons.
Press the 'RESET' button to clear the grid.

# Inspiration
This is a quick and simple program to start learning the Pygame module as I didn't want to use a pencil in my new [Murdle](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14egqqw/i_made_murdlecom_an_online_murdermystery_puzzle/) game book or waste paper elsewhere.  There are other online versions of the game and more detailed puzzles not covered by the simple grid used here.  But something I might do once I get to those !
